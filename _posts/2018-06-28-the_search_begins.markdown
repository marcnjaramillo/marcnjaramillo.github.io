I have finally graduated my program, and am now officially on the hunt for a new job.

I have to admit, I am pretty nervous about it. I am brand new to the tech field, and the only work I have to showcase is stuff that I've done in my program. I also don't have a ton of connections right now. I know, I know..."it's not what you know, it's who you know", "people get people jobs"... I get it. Networking is important, and not just for job-seeking. I have spent most of my time learning and working alone without the benefit of interaction with people who are already seasoned developers. I feel like I'm coming into this really late in the game, but it has honestly been a juggling act from day one. I want to learn from people and meet others who can give me their perspectives on what I'm doing, but I don't always have the time because I still have to work and pay my bills. So here are my goals for the next year as I undertake this search.

## Meet People

I've already started this one, but it's something that I need to do regularly. The challenge is finding meetups that fit my schedule, but it has to be done. I can also ask people that I meet if they know of other groups that meet regularly without an officlal Meetup group established. I'm an introvert, so meeting new people is a challenge for me; however, I cannot let my fear of putting myself out there hold me back from progressing in this field.

## Blog

So...full disclosure: I am really bad at this. I like writing, but I get stuck with what to write and then I end up doing other things instead of making the effort to get un-stuck. But I figure that the more I commit to making this a habit the easier it will be to find things to write about and it won't be so hard to stick to. Plus, it's a good way to keep myself accountable and track my progress. Who knows? Maybe my posts will inspire other people who find themselves dealing with something similar.

## Keep Coding

Kind of a no-brainer...if I want a job as someone who codes, I need to be writing code. But again, this goes back to the whole "I learned completely by myself without the benefit of outside help and I feel lost" thing I alluded to before. My goal is to do something every single day. How is that going so far you ask?

Okay, it could use some work. What I am trying to remind myself is that when I do something it doesn't have to work perfectly. It's okay to commit changes to my repo that don't work yet because at least I'm trying new things. It shows that I am making progress even if it isn't fully polished.

For example, in one of my projects I am finding that I need to change my models and associations. These changes will necesitate a change to a significant amount of the code I have already written, including the database tables. I have to try to change those tables, change my controllers and actions, and then change the frontend code so that everything still works. And I realize it may not work. But if I don't try, I'll never know.

## Stay Tuned

I hope that in a few months time I will be able to report that I have found a new job and that all my work has paid off. Regardless of how long it takes, I'm here to stay. So get used to me. It's going to be a bumpy ride!
