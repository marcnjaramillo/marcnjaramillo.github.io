It has taken me *way* longer to get here than I thought it would. This has been a difficult journey in many ways; life has really put a lot of obstacles in my way, but I was able to overcome them and get to the finish line. I don't really want to talk about the specifics of my app and how I built it out, but I want to talk about the path that led me to Flatiron and how I was able to persist.

## Time for a Change
I have been a sign language interpreter for almost 10 years now, and while it is a rewarding and often challenging job, I felt that it was time to move on to something different that I could really sustain myself on. Interpreting is tough phsyically and mentally, and often times it's feast or famine when you're a freelancer like me. I had always been fascinated with technology - after all, I grew up with it. And while I'm a nerd and love math, science, and all that nerdy-goodness, a career in tech seemed impossible. After all, I was already heavily invested in one field, and I couldn't imagine starting over with schooling to switch careers. But it was always there in my mind that maybe I could...if I really wanted to.

So one day I'm working with my friend who ran a local agency, trying to help her figure out a software they purchased for scheduling. And...it was awful. It offered *WAY* too many options that did not fit the unique needs of a sign language referral agency, and it was impossible to figure out how to create an assignment and then assign an interpreter to that assignment. I had a thought: why don't I create an app? After all, I know what sign language referral agencies need, and I have an interest in software and app development. Now I had my goal. 

## Enter Flatiron
I started doing some research online for the best way to learn coding. There's lots of free stuff out there, but it really lacks guidance. And, since technology is constantly evolving, something I read on a blog or StackOverflow thread might be no good (or at least bad practice). I researched several bootcamps, and I really liked what I saw in Flatiron. I appreciate structure and opportunities to practice. I felt that this was the best place for me to get started, so I took the free Ruby and JavaScript courses, applied, and was accepted...almost two years ago.

## Life...Ugh
I thought for sure I'd be done in a year. But life had other plans for me. I've had to stop my progress several times along the way, sometimes for months at a time. Things always seemed to pile on, and on top of trying to work as close to a full-time schedule as I could juggling three different sources of income, I found that I didn't always have the energy to dedicate to learning. But what I was learning was sticking, because even though I had some pretty big pauses, I could remember most of what I had done and didn't need to do a lot of re-learning. And it finally worked. I'm at the end. No, the goal I set out to complete isn't perfected; it only has some of the functionality I want. But I'm ready to find a new job in this field, and I am looking forward to continuing to develop my application into something that will be really useful to a lot of people. 

If you read this and you feel like it's taking you too long to get something, or it's harder than you thought to learn these skills, **DON'T GIVE UP**. Keeping on moving, as slow or fast as you can. Progress is progress, and if this is your passion you can succeed!
