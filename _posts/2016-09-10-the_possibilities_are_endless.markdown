I grew up using computers, but my expertise was limited to the things I used the most -- and even then, there was a lot I didn't understand. I think technology is amazing, and it's incredible to look back and see the progress that's been made just within the past decade. I will admit, though, I never thought I would get into software development. I love math (weird, I know), science, and I'm a very analytical person; still, I always thought that it would be really difficult to learn programming and that it would take a long time to produce anything decent. Boy, was I wrong!

I started learning to code about a year ago when I decided it was time to make a career change. I love the work that I currently do, but I didn't want it to be the only skill I had. I didn't know what other options I had open to me that wouldn't require me to go back to school and go even further into debt. Then, one day a crazy thought crossed my mind: "Hey! Why not try programming?" So I turned to my trusted advisor - Google - and started searching for resources and ways to learn. I didn't realize what an open community this was! There's a lot of free stuff out there, and it was relief to know I could get started without having to go back to sitting in a classroom. I worked on a couple of different sites (some free, some paid) and got sort of comfortable with HTML and CSS, and comfortable-ish with JavaScript and jQuery. But I lacked confidence in my abilities. 

Eventually, I came across The Flatiron School and took the free Intro to Ruby and Intro to JavaScript courses. I knew immediately that this was the program I wanted to be a part of. Learning on my own left me with some pretty big gaps, and I lacked confidence. Being apart of the Learn community has made a HUGE difference. I feel like I have a better grasp of HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript. I get to work on a TON of labs which helps the things I learn stick. Now I can really see the possibilites of what I can do with these skills, and it's awesome! Software development is a lot of work, and there is so much to learn, but it's a great deal of fun, too. I wish I had made this switch sooner!
