When I first started the Full-Stack Web Development program last month, I hit the ground running. I was moving at a really quick pace for a couple of different reasons: I love to learn (and I have been picking up coding pretty fast), and I want to get a freelance business up and running. The latter reason has been the biggest drive because I went to part-time employment to have more time for learning how to code. I have accomplished a lot in that time, and I want to share what I have done. I felt confident about my decision because I already had a foundation before coming to the Flatiron School, so please don't think that this is the best way to get into web development. My situation is unique to me, and that includes my learning style and abilities. I don't want anyone to feel like they have to learn coding at a marathon pace like I have been doing. Instead, look at this blog as an example of what you can accomplish when you have a clear goal and set your mind to get it done. It will look different for everyone, but I can tell you that in order to get as far as I have, I had to push myself, and along the way I discovered a Marc I didn't know existed. That's what I want everyone to gain from my experience: courage to push yourself and discover a new You.


## The Beginning of It All
When I started, I was pleased to see that some of the work I had done in the free courses already fit into the Full-Stack curriculum. True, it wasn't much, but I felt like I was given a head-start. In the first two weeks I had a total completion of 174 lessons (including the lessons that moved over from the free courses). Here's why: I had completed the Front-End Web Developer nanodegree program at Udacity, and I also explored some of their other free courses to learn more about JavaScript, so I was already comfortable with Git/GitHub, HTML, and CSS. Interestingly enough, those are the first things covered in the program. This allowed me to really fly through those courses because I already understood the concepts being taught. Ruby was next, and having completed the Intro to Ruby course prior to enrollment, I was able to move pretty quickly through those courses.


## My First Creation
Still, I felt that I needed to do something a little different to give myself some legitimacy as a web developer. I decided to build a portfolio site. I had projects from the schooling I had done, but no place to put them on display. I had a pretty good grasp of Ruby, so I thought I would try using Rails to build something. I knew it would be a while before I got into Rails with the Full-Stack program, so I did some digging and found a [Rails tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/) that gave me a very basic understanding of how Rails worked. It took me about a week, and I was able to get [my first Rails app](https://marc-jaramillo-portfolio.herokuapp.com/) up and running. Even though I wasn't active on Learn, I was really proud of what I had accomplished because this was the first big thing I created on my own. It was such a boost to my confidence, and I felt like I could really do good work as a web developer. I knew I had a lot to learn still, but this was something I never thought I would be able to do. I have since created a new [personal site](http://www.mnjwebdevelopment.com/) that still uses some parts of my first app with some tweaks. 

## What's the Point?
I wanted to emphasize again that this is how I have decided to learn web development. I like to jump around and play with new things before I fully understand the old things. It's just how my brain works. For anybody reading this, the point is to push yourself. Push the limits on what you think you can do. Push the limits of what you think is possible. You might be surprised by what happens when you do. I know I was.
